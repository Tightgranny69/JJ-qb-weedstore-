Hello my name is Jason Hall and this is my first script with the programming lauguage lua i hope you like it !

how to apply the weed seeds into the store 

first you want to Add this script Item to qb-core/shared/items.lua copy and paste!
["weed_seeds"] = {
    name = "weed_seeds",
    label = "Weed Seeds",
    weight = 100,
    type = "item",
    image = "weed_seeds.png",
    unique = false,
    useable = false,
    description = "A handful of weed seeds, perfect for growing your own stash.",
},

Now that you added that into the correct spot next step is to add the image you want to use for the seed 
Add Image for Inventory UI (Optional)
Navigate to qb-inventory/html/images/

Add an image named weed_seeds.png

Make sure you ensure qb-weedstore in the main server cfg file on your server 


Restart the server, and the item will appear properly in the inventory.

Good luck :0 created by Jason Hall jr
